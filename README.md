# 3D Printable 20 Segment Display
### This is a fully 3D printed segmented display designed for use with 5mm LEDs
You can use any type, but it wass designed to be used in conjunction with the WS2812 through-hole type, soldered to a custom PCB.

All of the 3D files are available in .stl and .step format in the "Objects" folder.

The arucino code for this version is available in the "Code" folder. It requires that you install the Adafruit neopixel libary within the Arduino IDE. 

PCB files will be added to this repository soon.
